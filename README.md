# Inception Wrapper Script

This program saves time for following operations:
1) Helps in listing micro-services based on datacenter and environment [staging/production/dev]
2) Helps find server fqdn for micro-services
3) List every environments from given datacenter
4) Checks /info, /check, /health endpoint for each micro-service as per user needs

Finally, made these scripts inside a container, so can be run by eveyone - doesn't need to bother about depended modules
